## Configuring MkDocs
In the `mkdocs.yml` file situated in the root of the wiki one could add or remove features of MkDocs. We recommend using the plugins provided to streamline all Greenhouse projects with same template. 

To add headers and files, the `nav:` needs to be updated. Here you can see how this wiki is structured.

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: 'index.md'
  - Project: 
    - 'Structure': 'Project/project.md'
    - 'Test': 'Project/testing/test.md'
    - Source:
      - 'src': 'Project/src/src.md'
      - 'components': "Project/src/components/components.md"
  - MkDocs:
    - 'Writing MkDocs': 'MkDocs/mkdocs-writing.md'
    - 'CI/CD With MkDocs': 'MkDocs/mkdocs-ci.md'
  - CI/CD:
    - 'Contiuous integration': 'CI/ci.md'
  - Git prehooks:
    - 'prehooks': 'git/prehooks.md'
  - GitHub issues and kanban board:
    - Issues: 'github/issues.md'
    - Kanban board: 'github/kanban.md'

```

We recommend using folders to keep the md files organized. If the project contains many folders, a good rule of thumb is
to have a md file for every folder, explaining what the folder contains
