# Components

General knowledge of how the components work, if larger file, it might be good to create an md file of the specific component.


Code snippets is good to have if there is something that is hard to understand by only looking at the code


Example:
```py
def create_markdown_file(file_name, content):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)
    print(f"Markdown file '{file_name}' created successfully.")
```
